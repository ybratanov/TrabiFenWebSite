# TrabiFenWebSite
Hello friends. This is a project for a Trabant fan site, my favorite car since childhood. The site is Passive, there are very few active buttons and dynamics, because I am still learning how to do things, if anyone has ideas, I will be happy to share them with me.
This is website with my projects. Fen Site for Trabant
