          <h3>Basic information</h3>
          <p>
            Trabant (German: [tʁaˈbant] i) is a series of small cars produced
            from 1957 until 1991 by former East German car manufacturer VEB
            Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau. Four models were made: the
            Trabant 500, Trabant 600, Trabant 601, and the Trabant 1.1. The
            first model, the 500, was a relatively modern car when it was
            introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            It featured a duroplast body on a steel chassis, front-wheel drive,
            a transverse two-stroke engine, and independent suspension. Because
            this 1950s design remained largely unchanged until the introduction
            of the last model, the Trabant 1.1 in 1990, the Trabant became
            symbolic of the former East Germany's stagnant economy and the
            collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general.[3] Called "a spark plug
            with a roof", 3,096,999 Trabants were produced.[4] Older models have
            been sought by collectors in the United States due to their low cost
            and fewer restrictions on the importation of antique cars. The
            Trabant also gained a following among car tuning and rallying
            enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Origins VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau had its origins in
            the former Auto Union/DKW business which had operated out of the
            site prior to the war, and the company's first products were
            essentially copies of pre-war DKW designs. Following the partition
            of Germany, Auto Union re-established itself in West Germany
            (ultimately evolving into Audi), leaving VEB Sachsenring with the
            two stroke engine inherited from DKW. The Trabant was the result of
            a planning process which had been intended to design a three-wheeled
            motorcycle.[6] In German, Trabant is an astronomical term for a moon
            (or other natural satellite) of a celestial body.[22]

          <h3 style="text-align: center">Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The German word Trabant, derived from Middle High German drabant,
            means 'satellite' or 'companion'.[a] The car's name was inspired by
            the Soviet Sputnik satellite.[6][7] The cars are often referred to
            as "Trabbi" or "Trabi". Produced without major changes for nearly 30
            years, the Trabant became the most common automobile in East
            Germany. It came to symbolize the country during the fall of the
            Berlin Wall in 1989, as images of East Germans crossing the border
            into West Germany were broadcast around the globe.[8][9]
            Manufactured by a state monopoly, acquiring a Trabant took about ten
            years.[10] East German buyers were placed on a waiting-list of up to
            thirteen years.[11] The waiting time depended on their proximity to
            Berlin, the capital.[6] Official state price was 7,450 GDR marks and
            the demand to production ratio was forty three to one (1989). The
            free market price for a second-hand one was more than twice the
            price of a new one, and the average worker had to wait ten to
            thirteen years on a waiting list, or, if available, pay more than
            double for a second hand model.[11] Simple automobile interior
            Interior of a 601 The Trabant had a steel frame, with the roof, boot
            lid, bonnet, wings and doors made of duroplast, a hard plastic made
            from recycled cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins
            from the East German dye industry.[6][12] It was the second car with
            a body made of recycled material; the first was the AWZ P70 Zwickau,
            produced from 1955 to 1959. The material was durable, and the
            average lifespan of a Trabant was 28 years.[12]
          </p>
          <p>
            The Trabant's build quality was poor,[13] reliability was
            terrible,[10][11][14] and it was loud, slow, and poorly designed.[3]
            The car had four principal variants: <br />
            The Trabant P 50, also known as the Trabant 500 (produced 1957–1962)
            <br />
            The Trabant 600 (1962–1965) <br />
            The Trabant 601 (1964–1990) <br />
            The Trabant 1.1, produced in 1990–1991 with a 1,043 cc (63.6 cu in)
            VW engine Trabant with the hood up; the engine is small. Trabant
            two-stroke engine <br />The engine for the 500, 600 and the original
            601 was a small two-stroke engine with two cylinders, accounting for
            the vehicle's modest performance. Its curb weight was about 600 kg
            (1,323 lb). When it ceased production in 1989, the Trabant delivered
            26 PS (19 kW) from 594 cc (36.2 cu in) displacement. It took 21
            seconds to accelerate from zero to its top speed of 100 km/h (62
            mph).[15][16]

          <h3>Full Production</h3>
          <p>
            The first of the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke
            Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a relatively
            advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year,
            with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent
            suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By
            the late 1950s, many small West European cars (such as the Renault)
            had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary
            constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but
            inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically
            equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized
            car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant
            had a front, transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive in an
            era when many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or
            front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback
            was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine
            made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.
            The Trabant's air-cooled, 500 cc (31 cu in) engine—upgraded to 600
            cc (37 cu in) in 1962–63—was derived from a pre-war DKW design with
            minor alterations during its production run. The first Saab car had
            a larger (764 cc), water-cooled, two-cylinder two-stroke engine.
            Wartburg, an East German manufacturer of larger sedans, also used a
            water-cooled, three-cylinder, 1,000 cc (61 cu in), two-stroke DKW
            engine.

            Trabant's base model, it shared a large number of interchangeable
            parts with the latest 1.1s. The 500 cc, 17 PS (13 kW) P50 evolved
            into a 20 PS (15 kW) version with a fully synchronized gearbox in
            1960, and received a 23 PS (17 kW), 600 cc (37 cu in) engine in 1962
            as the P 60.

          <h3>1989-1991</h3>
          <p>
            In mid-1989, thousands of East Germans began loading their Trabants
            with as much as they could carry and drove to Hungary or
            Czechoslovakia en route to West Germany–the so-called "Trabi Trail".
            Many had to get special permission to drive their Trabants into West
            Germany. The cars did not meet West German emissions standards and
            polluted the air at four times the European average.[23]
          </p>
          <p>
            A licensed version of the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the
            Trabant's two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between
            East and West Germany. The first prototypes were built in 1988, with
            pre-series cars appearing in 1989, but series production only began
            in May 1990 - By which time the two German states had already agreed
            to reunification. The locally built EA111-series engine was given
            the model code BM 820 by the East Germans; the plant also made
            1.3-liter versions for the Wartburg 1.3 (BM 860) and the Barkas
            utility vehicle (BM 880).[24] The model, the Trabant 1.1, also had
            minor improvements to its brake and signal lights, a renovated
            grille, and MacPherson struts instead of a leaf-spring-suspended
            chassis.
          </p>
          <p>
            By April 1991, after only eleven months, the Trabant 1.1 was
            discontinued. In total, 3.7 million Trabant vehicles had been
            produced.[25] However, it soon became apparent that there was no
            place for the Trabant in a reunified German economy. Its
            inefficient, labour-intensive production line had only survived
            thanks to government subsidies.

            The Zwickau factory in Mosel (where the Trabant was manufactured)
            was sold to Volkswagen AG; the rest of the company became HQM
            Sachsenring GmbH. Volkswagen redeveloped the Zwickau factory into a
            centre for engine production; it also produces some Volkswagen Golfs
            and Passats.
